# Applications of finite automata project
The goal of the project was to construct a minimal deterministic finite automata by a given regular expression extended with operations for intersection, complement, reversal and difference. 

I have used the power set construction algorithm for determinisation and the Hopcroft's algorithm for minimization. I managed to do the extended operations using De Morgan's laws.

The example automata accepts only valid and existing dates i.e. it doesn't accept dates such as 29th of February 2017.
